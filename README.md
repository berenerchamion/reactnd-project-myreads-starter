# MyReads Project

This is my final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.

Not much to the install - just grab the code (copy, clone, fork, etc.). CD to
the directory and then run and npm install and then start it up with:

yarn start

Keep in mind that the solution is restricted to the searching keywords as defined in the rubric.
